# CodSoft Internship Projects — Built by Ashutosh

Hey there! This repo contains three Python projects I made as part of my CodSoft internship. Each project focuses on core logic, clean code, and making things that *just work*. No fancy frameworks, no unnecessary complexity—just thoughtful functionality.

## What's inside?

### 1. Calculator (CLI)
> A basic command-line calculator that lets you enter two numbers and choose an operation—add, subtract, multiply, or divide.

- Handles invalid input and division-by-zero cases.
- Simple layout that’s easy to expand.
- File: `calculator_project/calculator.py`

### 2. To-Do List (Terminal App)
> A no-nonsense task tracker you can run straight from your terminal.

- Add, view, mark done, or delete tasks.
- Clean prompts and readable status labels.
- File: `todo_project/todo_list.py`

### 3. Password Generator
> Enter the desired password length and get a solid, random password with letters, digits, and symbols.

- Uses Python’s built-in `random` and `string` modules.
- Keeps the code minimal but secure.
- File: `password_project/password_generator.py`
